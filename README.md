## Requirements before installing

- Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.
- Clean install of Kerbal Space Program. (I use the Steam Version, so experience on the GoG version may vary)
- 2.88GB of space for downloads, 6.33GB for install, for a total of 9.21GB space.

## Game Preparations

Once Kerbal Space Program is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the main menu, and exit).

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe
5. Click 'Browse Modlists'
6. Locate Box of Rockets and click the 'Download Modlist' button
7. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Box of Rockets). This location CANNOT be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.
8. The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.
9. Click the "Play" arrow.
10. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
11. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

## Warp Mods
Select one of the following mods:
- WarpDrive - Adds a simple warp drive, highly suggested if not using KSP Interstellar Extended, as there are many very far away planets and stars.
- KSP Interstellar Extended - Very detailed, and complex mod that adds FTL travel.

## Optional Mods
The following mods are optional, and can either be left disabled, or you can enable them as you wish:
- TweakScale - Allows you to change sizes of many parts in the hangars. Seen as 'Cheaty' by many serious players.
- MechJeb - Adds autopilot options that can be unlocked as you progress through the tech tree. Also seen as cheaty.
- HyperEdit - A cheat mod which adds some nice things.
- Real Chute - Adds more realistic parachute simulation, is more complicated and increases difficulty.
- Kerbal Weather Program - Adds weather simulation, including wind and thermal effects on flight. Makes flight more difficult.

## Countdown to Launch

**That’s almost it!** Launch MO2 in the install folder, and click the 'Run' button to launch the game/
From now on, launch the game through MO2. <br>

Also, make sure your settings are adjusted to match those in the In Game Setup document: https://github.com/LaughingHyena279/BoxOfRockets/blob/main/In%20Game%20Setup.md

## Impotant mods
These mods are important parts of the Box of Rockets experience, so it's a good idea to take a look at them and see what they are about!
- Galaxies Unbound - This mod greately expands the universe you can explore! Using either WarpDrive or KSP Interstellar Extened is REQUIRED to get to most of the added planets!
- Editor Extensions Redux - This mod adds lots of new functions to make building easier/more convenient
- Near Future mods - These add lots of later game parts to expand your options for spacecraft!
- Better Time Warp - Adds more options for time warp, so you can better control your game.
- Kerbal Engineer - Adds lots of great information so you can min/max your space travel experience!

**DISCLAIMER:**
While KSP is a very moddable game with many mods out there, if you add mods yourself you do so at your own risk, and no support will be provided. If you wish to suggest a new mod, please do so here: https://forms.gle/xTuy2y8UHQm7VAYSA
