## Requirements before installing

- Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.
- Clean install of Kerbal Space Program, with all DLCs, Non-negotiable. (I use the Steam Version, so experience on the GoG version may vary)
- 500Mb of spave. Yes, you read that right.

## Game Preparations

Once Kerbal Space Program is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the main menu, and exit).

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe
5. Click 'Browse Modlists'
6. Locate Box of Rockets and click the 'Download Modlist' button
7. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Box of Rockets). This location CANNOT be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.
8. The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.
9. Click the "Play" arrow.
10. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
11. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

## Optional Mods
The following mods are optional, and can either be left disabled, or you can enable them as you wish:
MechJeb - Adds autopilot options that can be unlocked as you progress through the tech tree. Seen as 'Cheaty' by many serious KSP players.
WarpDrive - Adds a simple warp drive, highly suggested if not using KSP Interstellar Extended, as there are many very far away planets and stars.
KSP Interstellar Extended - Very detailed, and complex mod that adds FTL travel.

## Countdown to Launch

**That’s almost it!** Launch MO2 in the install folder, and click the 'Run' button to launch the game/
From now on, launch the game through MO2. <br>

**DISCLAIMER:**
While KSP is a very moddable game with many mods out there, if you add mods yourself you do so at your own risk, and no support will be provided. If you wish to suggest a new mod, please do so here: https://forms.gle/xTuy2y8UHQm7VAYSA
